1.CPU-COCK - gives information about CPU, was not able to get more due to windows OS restriction.<br>
2.EngineSandbox - hald an year ago experimented with openGL and rendering APIs. Plan to redo it more accuratly, because the code is awful.<br>
3.tanki - started a week ago. Originally was suppose to be a simple console game with shooting tanks, but I decided to make a console game engine and add multiplayer in future. <br>
